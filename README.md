## Project Description
The domain of our project is the logistics of social media influencer marketing. This project primarily addresses the data related to influencers on social media and their collaboration with sponsors to promote products through posts. By modeling this aspect of the domain, we want our application to target people who are interested in the economics of influencer marketing to discover insightful trends and information from a database that contains data generated by the influencer industry. Their discoveries may further help them in either their own career or enhance their understanding of the social media influencer economy.

## Reference
This project has used the provided resources (demo project) in tutorial for javascript: https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-304/resources/javascript-oracle-resources/node-setup.html

## Note about sql files
1. the table_creation.sql is the one required by this project
2. queries.sql cannot be run. It just give a better view for people to see all the query we used

## How to run the project
1. log into Oracle with username: sqlplus ora_cwl@stu and password: a<student number>
2. run the table_creation.sql to load the data into the database
3. type "cd Project" in the terminal to go to the project folder
4. type sh remote-start.sh to run the project
5. click the link to open the local host

### Time Line 
|Tasks|Deadline|Assignment|Challenge|
|-----|--------|----------|---------|
|Double check on requirement, confirm on tasks needed (transform into userstory if needed); Decide on what queries backend need to handle and front end need to send to complete all the functionalities we want    |      2025/07/26 | Everyone|There might be some functionality that requires complex query. We will either do some research or go to OH for help when needed|
|Have a draft UI design sketch |2025/07/26|Everyone|-|
|SQL script to create all tables and data in the database|2025/07/26|Everyone| - |
|Coding for backend controllers (send request to DB, receive request from frontend)|2025/07/30 (4 days)|Everyone|We might need to create tests, or it’s probably tricky to see if we did the right thing. For connection to the database, there might be unexpected issues. As we are doing this part early, we left ourselves enough time for debugging and asking questions|
|Coding for frontend functions that send the request|2025/08/02 (3 days)|Everyone|Format of the request, error handling|
Coding for frontend components and adding functionality to them by calling the functions; Test frontend and backend’s integration and debug if needed|2025/08/04 (2 days)|Everyone|Building UI components should be pretty straight forward, and we leave 2 more days after this stage as buffer time for debugging|
|Write up the milestone 4 PDF file deliverable|2025/08/06 (2 days)| Everyone (2 days)| - |
|Styling frontend (if we still have time)|2025/08/06|Everyone | - |
